# Optimising Retail Inventory with Multi-Agent Systems

This project explores how multi-agent systems can be used to optimize inventory levels in retail using agent-based modeling, simulation, and intelligent decision-making.

## Features
- Intelligent inventory agents managing stock levels.
- Supplier agents that respond to orders.
- Simulation environment for testing retail scenarios.

## Technologies
- Python
- Agent-based modeling (e.g., Mesa or custom agents)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-inventory-multi-agent.git
